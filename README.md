# Disclaimer

This program **DOES NOT** encourage piracy at all!  
It was designed to reduce the time to download/install a game from the Nintendo eShop.  
In case you have a ADSL connection, to install latest `Zelda` ([14.4Gb](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-switch/)) it can take ages!

On top of that, if you have bought a game on eShop like [Jump Force](https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/jump-force-sunsetting-announcement), once it is not anymore on the shop how can you install it again?  
Using your personal NSP dump, with `tinfoil` and `tinshop` everything should be fine and fast!

# Use

To proper use this software, here is the checklist:
- [ ] _Optional:_ A proper configured `config.yaml`
    - [ ] Copy/Paste [`config.example.yaml`](https://github.com/DblK/tinshop/blob/master/config.example.yaml) to `config.yaml`
    - [ ] Comment/Uncomment parts in the config according to your needs
- [ ] Games should have in their name `[ID][v0]` to be recognized
- [ ] Retrieve binary from [latest release](https://github.com/DblK/tinshop/releases) or build from source (See `Dev` section below)

Now simply run it and add a shop inside tinfoil with the address setup in `config` (or `http://localIp:3000` if not specified).

# Features

Here is the list of all main features so far:
- [X] Automatically download `titles.US.en.json` if missing at startup
- [X] Basic protection from forged queries (should allow only tinfoil to use the shop)
- [X] Serve from several mounted directories
- [X] Serve from several network directories (Using NFS)
- [X] Display a webpage for forbidden devices
- [X] Auto-refresh configuration on file change
- [X] Add the possibility to whitelist or blacklist a switch
- [X] Add the possibility to ban theme
- [X] You can specify custom titledb to be merged with official one
- [X] Auto-watch for mounted directories

# Dev or build from source

I suggest to use a tiny executable [gow](https://github.com/mitranim/gow) to help you during the process (hot reload, etc..).  
For example I use the following command to develop `gow -c run .`.

If you want to build `TinShop` from source, please run `go build`.

And then, simply run `./tinshop`.

## Want to do cross-build generation?

Wanting to generate all possible os binaries (macOS, linux, windows) with all architectures (arm, amd64)?  
Here is the command `goreleaser release --snapshot --skip-publish --rm-dist`.

Dead simple, thanks to Golang!

## Changing the structure of an interface?

If you change an interface (or add a new one), do not forget to execute `./update_mocks.sh` to generate up-to-date mocks for tests.

# Roadmap

You can see the [roadmap here](https://github.com/DblK/tinshop/projects/1).

If you have any suggestions, do not hesitate to participate!

# Q & A

## Why use this instead of `X` (NUT or others software)?

It's dead simple, and no dependencies! It's just a single small executable.  
Easier to install games without connecting switch or by updating SD card (Nightmare if you are on macOS).

The upcoming features will also be a huge advantage against others software.

## Where do I put my games?

By default, `TinShop` will look into the `games` directory relative to `tinshop` executable.

However in the `config.yaml` file, you can change this.  
In the `sources` section, you can have the following:
- `directories`: List of directories where you put your games
- `nfs`: List of NFS shares that contains your games


## Can I set up a `https` endpoint?

Yes, you can!  
Use a reverse proxy (like [traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik), [caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy), nginx...) to do tls termination and forward to your instance on port `3000`.

## How can I add a `basic auth` to protect my shop?

TinShop **does not** implement basic auth by itself.  
You should configure it inside your reverse proxy.

For other type of protection, you can whitelist your own switch and this will do the trick.

## I have tons of missing title displayed in `tinfoil`, what should I do?

First, download and replace the latest [`titles.US.en.json`](https://github.com/AdamK2003/titledb/releases/download/latest/titles.US.en.json) available (or delete it, it will be automatically downloaded at startup).  
If this does not solve your issue, then you should use custom titledb entry to describe those which are missing.
